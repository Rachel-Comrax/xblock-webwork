The main settings which are expected to provide access to a WeBWorK server
for problem rendering and grading are expected to be stored in the
"Other Course Settings" JSON dictionary which is available since the
Ironwood release when the ENABLE_OTHER_COURSE_SETTINGS is set to true in the
the cms.env.json file.

The config data is included inside the main JSON object inside a single JSON
object whose key is "webwork_settings".

  * Required to level inner keys:
    * "server_settings" whose value is a object whose keys are the IDs, and each
      value is an object of the settings needed for that server.
    * "course_defaults" whose value is a object whose key-value pairs set default
      values for the current course.

  * Fields in the "server_settings" object:
      * Key = the "ww_server_id" which can be selected to use this group of settings.
      * Value is a object containing at least the following required settings per server:
        * "server_type" either "standalone" or "html2xml"
        * "server_url" = the head portion of the URL where the API is.
	  * Examples:
	    * "https://myserver.mydomain.tld/webwork2/html2xml"
	    * "https://myserver.mydomain.tld:3000/render-api"
        * "auth_data" = object of key-value pairs needed for the authentication and
	  secure communucations with the relevant server
          * for "server_type" = "html2xml" this includes:
	    * "ww_course", "ww_username", "ww_password"
          * for "server_type" = "standalone" this inlcudes:
	    * nothing at present. FIXME to handle JWT secret, auth settings, etc.
  * Fields in the "course_defaults" object:
    * "default_server" whose value is one of the entries in the prior array. (required)
    * "default_show_answers" (boolean) should show answers be made available after
      the relevant answer_delay.
      (optional, default to true)
    * "default_show_solutions" (boolean) should solutions (if they exist) be made available
      after the relevant answer_delay.
      (optional, default to true)
    * "default_allow_hints" (boolean) should hints (if they exist) be permitted.
      (optional, default to false)
    * "default_post_deadline_lockdown" = # of minutes after the deadline during which
       submissions are forbidden (except for the grace perion).
       (optional, default to 2880 minutes = 48 hours)
    * "default_answer_delay" = # of minutes after deadline when answers become
       available to the students.
       (optional, default to 2880 minutes = 48 hours)
    * "default_html_lang" = default setting for the main LANG attribute inside the iFrame.
       (optional, when not provided, the webwork server defaults will apply)
    * "default_html_dir" = default setting for the main DIR attribute inside the iFrame.
       (optional, when not provided, the webwork server defaults will apply)

The main settings which are expected to provide access to a WeBWorK server
for problem rendering and grading are expected to be stored in the
"Other Course Settings" JSON dictionary which is available since the
Ironwood release when the ENABLE_OTHER_COURSE_SETTINGS is set to true in the
the cms.env.json file.

The config data is included inside the main JSON object inside a single JSON
object whose key is "webwork_settings".

  * Required inner keys:
    * "server_list" whose value is an array of IDs (as strings) for the different
      servers available to this course
    * "default_server" whose value is one of the entries in the prior array.
    * "default_show_answers" (boolean) should show answers be made available after
      the relevant answer_delay
    * "default_answer_delay" = # of minutes after deadline when answers become
       available to the students
    * "default_html_lang" = default setting for the main LANG attribute inside the iFrame.
    * "default_html_dir" = default setting for the main DIR attribute inside the iFrame.
    * "server_settings" whose value is a object whose keys are the IDs, and each
      value is an object of the settings needed for that server.
      * Required settings per server:
        * "server_type" either "standalone" or "html2xml"
        * "server_url" = the head portion of the URL where the API is.
        * "auth_data" = dictionary of data needed for the authenication for the server
          * for "server_type" = "html2xml" this includes ... FIXME
          * for "server_type" = "standalone" ... FIXME

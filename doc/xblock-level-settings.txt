WAS GLOBAL - BEING REPLACED:
  WWSERVERLIST
  SERVER
  SERVERTYPE

"Global"
  main_settings   = the JSON config data retrieved from the course

XBlock fields

  Server related settings:
    settings_type = whether main settings are being used.. to allow manual
      override when no main settings
        When set to 1 (="Provided by course via "Other Course Settings")
          the server_id field should be populated with the available options
          and visible.
        When set to 2 (="Manual settings") the server_id field should be
          invisible
      
    server_id = when set, the ID of server from the main settings
      Visible when relevant, and options populated into values.

    For use when in manual mode - otherwise should be left as None and kept invisible
      server_type
      server_api_url
      server_static_files_url
      auth_data - when needed should be a JSON dictionary of the needed settings
        *** replacing 'ww_course', 'ww_username', 'ww_password' for html2xml mode
        *** for standalone mode now needs 'aud' and 'problemJWTsecret'
        *** help data should explain what is needed or FIXME + promise to explain

  Problem - main settings
    problem = Path for WW problem file (as expected on the WW server)
    max_allowed_score = Scores are scaled from the WeBWorK 0-1 range to 0-max_allowed_score.
    max_attempts
    no_attempt_limit_required_attempts_before_show_answers = controls when to allow viewing answers when no deadline and unlimited attempts
    weight = weight of problem in unit (edX standard field)
    settings_type = controls whether to use course-wide settigs about the remote server or ones set by the problem
    ww_server_id = which serverID to use from the course-wide settigs
    ww_server_type, ww_server_api_url, ww_server_static_files_url, auth_data = problem specific server settings (not recommended, use course-wide settings instead)

  Problem - display related settings
    ww_language = used to set the language of the translation dictionary to use on the WeBWorK side. (The standalone render supports "heb" = hebrew in addition to English at present.)

    # Probably do not need to be edited
    display_name
    iframe_min_height
    iframe_max_height
    iframe_min_width

  Problem - special settings - can usually be left with the default values
    allow_show_answers
    allow_ww_hints
    allow_ww_solutions_with_correct_answers
    problem_banner_text
    webwork_request_timeout
    post_deadline_lockdown


    custom_parameters = for future use

  User state for problem:  (Scope.user_state)
    student_answer
    student_attempts = total, but we also store ww_numCorrect, ww_numIncorrect (as Standalone uses them)
    best_student_score
    seed
    psvn_index = index number of which PSVN to use for this instance of the problem
      * Used to pull a value out of psvn_options (a Dict)
    submission_data_to_save (answers, etc. which get saved)
    student_viewed_correct_answers
    unique_id (internal, used to prevent identify iFrames, divs, etc. of different problems)

    done, last_submission_time - based on capa_module.py

    MAYBE:
      last_answer = WW format to allow reloading prior answers during initial rendering. Needs support on the standalone side

  User state for system (for course would be better but not possible):  (Scope.preferences)
    psvn_dict = dictionary (init as empty dict)
      keys are courseID, and value is a array of PSVN values for this user for this course.
        On first attempt to access the course array - create with 1 value, add more as needed
    *** The values in this array MUST be fixed for a entire course

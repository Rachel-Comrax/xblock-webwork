XBlock fields

  Server related settings:

      override when no main settings
        When set to 1 (="Provided by course via "Other Course Settings")
          the server_id field should be populated with the available options
          and visible.
        When set to 2 (="Manual settings") the server_id field should be
          invisible
      
    server_id = when set, the ID of server from the main settings
      Visible when relevant, and options populated into values.

    For use when in manual mode - otherwise should be left as None and kept invisible
      server_type
      server_url
      auth_data - when needed should be a JSON dictionary of the needed settings
        *** replacing 'ww_course', 'ww_username', 'ww_password' for html2xml mode
        *** help data should explain what is needed or FIXME + promise to explain

      * Used to pull a value out of psvn_array

    MAYBE:
      last_answer = WW format to allow reloading prior answers during initial rendering. Needs support on the standalone side

  User state for system (for course would be better but not possible):  (Scope.preferences)
    psvn_dict = dictionary (init as empty dict)
      keys are courseID, and value is a array of PSVN values for this user for this course.
        On first attempt to access the course array - create with 1 value, add more as needed
    *** The values in this array MUST be fixed for a entire course
